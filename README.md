💬 Chat Room Application
A simple multithreaded chat room application built using Python. It features a server and multiple clients with a GUI using either Tkinter or PyQt5.

📦 Requirements
Install all required Python packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
✅ Make sure you're using Python 3.8+.

🚀 How to Run
1. Start the Server
In the project root directory, run:

bash
Copy code
python server.py
This will start the central server that handles incoming client connections and relays messages between them.

2. Start the Client(s)
Go into any client folder (e.g., Client1, Client2, etc.) and run:

bash
Copy code
python send.py
Repeat this in separate terminals for each client instance.

💡 You can rename the client folder or copy it to simulate multiple users on the same system.


🛠️ Technologies Used
Python socket, threading, random, os (Standard Library)

PyQt5 or Tkinter for GUI

PySocks (optional for proxy support)

📌 Notes
All clients must run after the server is started.

Clients must connect to the correct IP and port (configured in send.py).

Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (with Python 3.x).

Great! Based on the libraries you've used, here's your updated README.md specifically tailored to your PyQt5-based chat room project:

💬 PyQt5 Chat Room Application
A simple, multithreaded chat room app built using Python and PyQt5. This project features a server and multiple PyQt5-based clients that can communicate with each other in real-time.

📦 Requirements
Install all the required Python packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
requirements.txt contains:
txt
Copy code
PyQt5==5.15.9
PyQtWebEngine==5.15.9
PySocks==1.7.1
certifi==2024.6.2
⚠️ Python standard libraries like threading, socket, random, and os do not require installation.

🚀 How to Run
1. Start the Server
Run the following command in the root directory to launch the server:

bash
Copy code
python server.py
This will start the socket-based server to handle all chat communications.

2. Start the Client(s)
Navigate to any client folder (e.g., Client1, Client2, etc.) and run:

bash
Copy code
python send.py
You can open multiple clients in separate terminals to simulate a group chat.
